# Airbnb analysis: Project Overview

I analyzed neighborhood trends in Seattle, focusing on availability, prices, and visitor behaviors. The data was preprocessed by converting date formats, handling missing values, and encoding availability. I examined how new visitors impact availability and identified key months with high visitor influx. Additionally, I performed sentiment analysis on visitor reviews to extract the most frequent keywords associated with each neighborhood.
  
## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
**Kaggle Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swsw1717/seatle-airbnb-open-data-sql-project/data?select=calendar.csv

## Data Cleaning 
After getting the data, I needed to clean it up so that it was usable for our model. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

- Converted date columns and extracted year, month, and day features.
- Encoded availability (`t/f` â†’ 1/0) for easier analysis.
- Cleaned price data by removing symbols and converting to numeric format.
- Identified and analyzed new visitors by using listing duplication to track unique bookings.

## Sentiment Analysis
- Merged review comments with listing data to perform sentiment analysis for the top 20 neighborhoods.
- Applied text cleaning techniques (lowercasing, removing punctuation and stopwords) to extract relevant keywords.
- Created a model using `CountVectorizer` to identify the top 5 keywords for each neighborhood.
  
## EDA
I looked at the distributions of the data and the value counts for the various categorical variables. Below are a few highlights from the pivot tables.

## Key Questions 
* 1. Can you describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
* 2. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
* 3. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?

## Sentiment Analysis Results
- Performed sentiment analysis and identified the most frequently used words in reviews for the top 20 neighborhoods. The key terms for each neighborhood are:
  - **Broadway:** apartment, clean, comfortable, great, hill
  - **Central Business District:** apartment, clean, comfortable, great, perfect
  - **Columbia City:** city, clean, comfortable, great, nice
  - **East Queen Anne:** clean, comfortable, great, perfect, space
  - **Eastlake:** clean, comfortable, easy, great, nice
  - **Fairmount Park:** clean, comfortable, great, nice, west
  - **First Hill:** apartment, clean, comfortable, easy, great
  - **Fremont:** clean, comfortable, fremont, great, space
  - **Gatewood:** clean, comfortable, great, nice, recommend
- Based on these results, it appears that these neighborhoods are highly recommended.

## Busiest Month Analysis
- Using the `groupby` and `mean` functions, I determined that July is the busiest month for availability.
  - Monthly average availability:
    - **July:** 0.304679
    - **June:** 0.334716
    - **May:** 0.388274
    - **April:** 0.401806

## Cheapest Month and New Visitors
- After analyzing the average price per month and the presence of new visitors, I found that new visitors tend to book during the month with the lowest average price(June).
  - Monthly average prices:
    - **January:** 267.47
    - **February:** 267.47
    - **March:** 267.47
    - **April:** 267.47
    - **May:** 267.47s
    - **June:** 266.93
  - New visitors primarily booked in June, the month with the lowest average price.
